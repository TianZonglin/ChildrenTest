### The testing system of feelings focusing on Children

The system is a complete standard pipline to test children's feelings about [agree] or [disagree], the mean idea is to build up an interactive mode to create different status and then check the reflections of these children. 

If you want to use this system, you can just download the code and run it in any possible web container.
