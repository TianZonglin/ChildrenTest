# The testing system of feelings focusing on Children

# What

The system is a complete standard pipline to test children's feelings about [agree] or [disagree], the mean idea is to build up an interactive mode to create different status and then check the reflections of these children. 

# When

If you want to use this system, you can just download the code and run it in any possible web container.
